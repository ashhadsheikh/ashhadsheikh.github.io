# Monitoring Information System

I have worked on a Monitoring Information System for the office of Frequency Allocation Board which helped to bring the scattered paper based complaint management to a proper workflow based systematic approach. It streamlined the prcess and shortened the complaint duratin from 3 months to a period of 14 days and was deployed nationwide.
